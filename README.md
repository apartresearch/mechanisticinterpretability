A repository for awesome resources in mechanistic interpretability

## Mechanistic Interpretability lists

- [Neel Nanda's opinionated list of readings](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/favourite-papers): A list of Neel's favourite papers on the topic
- [The Interpretability Playground](https://alignmentjam.com/interpretability-playground): A large resources list for safety-minded interpretability research
- [AI Safety Ideas mechanistic interpretability research list](https://aisafetyideas.com/list/interpretability-hackathon): A list of research ideas in mechanistic interpretability

## Libraries

- [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens): A Library for Mechanistic Interpretability of Generative Language Models ([Colab](https://neelnanda.io/transformer-lens-demo))
- [Unseal](https://unseal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Mechanistic Interpretability for Transformers
- [BertViz](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz): BertViz is an interactive tool for visualizing attention in Transformer language models such as BERT, GPT2, or T5. It can be run inside a Jupyter or Colab notebook through a simple Python API that supports most Huggingface models. BertViz extends the Tensor2Tensor visualization tool by Llion Jones, providing multiple views that each offer a unique lens into the attention mechanism.


## Tools
